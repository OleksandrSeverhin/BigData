# --- 1. SETUP AND CONFIGURATION ---

# Use pacman to manage packages, which installs if missing and loads
if (!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman")
pacman::p_load(
  arrow,      # For reading Parquet files
  dplyr,      # For data manipulation
  ggplot2,    # For creating visualizations
  broom,      # For tidying model outputs
  car,        # For VIF (Variance Inflation Factor) calculation
  MASS,       # For stepAIC function
  patchwork   # For combining plots
)

# Set a consistent theme for all plots
theme_set(theme_minimal(base_size = 12))

# Ensure the 'plots' directory exists for saving images
if (!dir.exists("plots")) {
  dir.create("plots")
  cat("Created directory: plots/\n")
}

# --- 2. DATA LOADING ---

# Load the cleaned dataset from the previous session
tryCatch({
  taxi_data <- read_parquet("data/cleaned_yellow_tripdata_2025-01.parquet")
  cat("Cleaned dataset loaded successfully.\n")
  cat("Dimensions:", dim(taxi_data)[1], "rows,", dim(taxi_data)[2], "columns\n")
}, error = function(e) {
  stop("Failed to load the cleaned dataset. Make sure 'cleaned_yellow_tripdata_2025-01.parquet' is in the 'data/' directory.")
})


# --- 3. BASELINE MULTIPLE REGRESSION MODEL ---

# Fit a linear model with at least 5 predictors to predict total_amount.
# We'll use trip_distance, passenger_count, payment_method, pickup_hour, and day_of_week.
baseline_model <- lm(
  total_amount ~ trip_distance + passenger_count + payment_method + pickup_hour + day_of_week,
  data = taxi_data
)

# Print the model summary
cat("\n--- Summary of Baseline Multiple Regression Model ---\n")
print(summary(baseline_model))


# --- 4. DIAGNOSTICS FOR THE BASELINE MODEL ---

cat("\n--- Performing Diagnostics on Baseline Model ---\n")

# To avoid performance issues with plotting millions of points, we'll use a random sample for diagnostic plots.
set.seed(42)
diag_sample <- taxi_data 

# Re-fit the model on the sample for plotting purposes
baseline_model_sampled <- lm(
  total_amount ~ trip_distance + passenger_count + payment_method + pickup_hour + day_of_week,

)

# 4a. Linearity and Homoscedasticity (Residuals vs. Fitted Plot)
# We look for a random cloud of points around y=0. Patterns (like a funnel) suggest problems.

  )
ggsave("plots/baseline_residuals_vs_fitted.png", p1, width = 8, height = 6)

# We look for points falling closely along the diagonal line.

# --- 5. MODEL IMPROVEMENT ---

# The diagnostics suggest transformations are needed. The right-skew in the variables
# and the patterns in the residual plots point to a log transformation.

# 5a. Fit an improved model with log-transformed variables
# We log-transform the target (total_amount) and the main skewed predictor (trip_distance).
# This creates a log-log model, where coefficients represent elasticities.

# 5b. Use Stepwise Variable Selection to refine the model
# stepAIC will add/remove variables to find a model with the lowest AIC (Akaike Information Criterion).

# Note: This can take a moment to run on the full dataset.
